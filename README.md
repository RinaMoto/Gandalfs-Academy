# Gandalfs-Academy
## Project Outline: 
Gandalfâ€™s Sorcery Academy is a school for witches and wizards with 300 students learning magical pursuits. These students choose from 40 classes according to their interests, which can make keeping track of whether you are in Transfiguration or Blasting class this term a chore! Our database driven website will keep track of who is in which class, and what school materials they will need for them, taking the burden of organization off of the students so they can focus on spellcasting. Each student is assigned to one of five houses, and can purchase any of up to 25 books for their classes. There are 100 spells to learn in those books. 

### Some or all CRUD functionalities are implemented for the following entity tables.
